# Elementor Tab Slider
This is custom code that extends the Elementor Nested Tab as a slider too.

# üìù Description

I have written the custom Javascript(jQuery) code and CSS to make the Elementor Nested Tab widget into a Slider with a Progress bar. 

# How To Use

- Copy the Javascript code into your website's custom JS file or by Elementor Custom Code.
- Copy the CSS code into your website's custom CSS file or by Elementor Custom Code.
- Use this class "autoplay-tab" to the Elementor Nested Tab widget as a custom CSS class. 
- If you want the slider on mobile too, also add the "mobile-autoplay" class to the Elementor Nested Tab widget as a custom CSS class.
- This code will work for both Horizontal and Vertical Tab. Adjust them from the Elementor widget and customize the CSS according to your needs.
